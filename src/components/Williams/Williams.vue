          first Constructor's title with Alan Jones. Jones won the opening race
          in Argentina and then followed with four more wins at French GP,
          British GP, Canadian GP and the win at the last race in United States.
          Jones also won the driver's title 17 points ahead of Nelson Piquet. In
          the constructor's championship Williams almost had double the points

          Four" teams – Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton
          Senna – who won all but one of the 16 races that season. The season
          started in Brazil, where Piquet won and Senna finished second, while

          exchanged podium places, with Prost finishing the season with 11
          podium finishes. The only race where none of the four drivers won the
          race was Mexico GP which was won by Gerhard Berger. At the last race
