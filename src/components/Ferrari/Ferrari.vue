            The first Constructor's title was won 1961. Ferrari dominated the
            whole season failing to win only in Germany and Monaco. Phil Hill of
            Ferrari won his only Drivers' Championship after his teammate and
            rival Wolfgang von Trips was killed at the Italian Grand Prix, the
            penultimate race of the season.

            the Ferrari 312T, a car that was technically far superior to any of

            a huge margin over second place in the championship. Ferrari took
            home the championship trophy for manufacturers. Lauda often referred
            to 1975 as "the unbelievable year".
