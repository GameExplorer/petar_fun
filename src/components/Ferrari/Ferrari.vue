            whole season failing to win only in Germany and Monaco. Phil Hill of

            rival Wolfgang von Trips was killed at the Italian Grand Prix, the

            the Ferrari 312T, a car that was technically far superior to any of
            the competition. He won his first drivers' title with five wins and
            a huge margin over second place in the championship. Ferrari took
            home the championship trophy for manufacturers. Lauda often referred
            to 1975 as "the unbelievable year".
