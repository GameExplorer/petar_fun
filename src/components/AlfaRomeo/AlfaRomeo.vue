          The car was launched and raced in the season's early races with a
          distinctive narrow and drooping nose. At the San Marino GP, this was
          replaced by a more conventional raised nose carrying the front wing
          underneath on twin supports. Thus the car became a largely
          unremarkable mid-1990s F1 midfielder, although it was notable for
          being the only 1995 F1 car to feature the raised cockpit sides which
          would be mandated from 1996, and for achieving Sauber's first F1
          podium finish with Frentzen 3rd in Italy.<br />

          The car was plagued by weight issues early in the season, to the point
          that, to compensate for this, a tall Sutil did not eat for two days in
          a desperate attempt to remain competitive.<br />
          <br />
          Ultimately, the C33 had the unfortunate distinction of being the least
          competitive Sauber ever built, as Sauber failed to score points for
          the first time in their history in 2014. In addition, due to the
          financial status of the team, both drivers were dropped at the end of
          the season to make way for a new line up of Marcus Ericsson and Felipe
          Nasr.
