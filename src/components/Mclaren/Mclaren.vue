          Emerson Fittipaldi signed for Mclaren in 1974. At the opening race
          Fittipaldi collided and finished the race in the 10th place, his
          teammate Denny Hulme won the first race. In the following race
          Fittipaldi won in his home country. Up until French GP Fittipaldi had
          a great run and finished the races in the top 5 expect South Africa.
          His first retirement came in the French GP. Double DNF in Germany and
          Austria put Fittipaldi in a difficult position his rival Ragazzoni was
          leading the championship. Fittipaldi finished second in the Italian GP
          and won the Canadian GP. In the end Fittipaldi won the championship by
          3 points.

          Having been fired by Renault, Alan Prost returned to Mclaren. Mclaren
          used TAG engines and dominated the whole season. Mclaren had two times
          more points than the second place Ferrari. In the driver's
          championship it was hot. Niki Lauda and Alan Prost enjoyed the season
          long duel for the title. Prost won seven races to equal Jim Clark's
          record from 1963, over Lauda's five, but the Austrian eventually
          prevailed by half a point – the smallest margin in Formula One
          history. It was Lauda's third title, but his first since 1977. Lauda
          managed to win a title without scoring pole position.

          The 1988 season saw one of the greatest rivalries in the Formula 1
          history. Senna and Prost exchanged wins winning 15 out of 16 races,
          failing to win only in Italy where Gerhard Berger won for a ferrari
          four weeks after the death of the Enzo Ferrari. Despite having more
          podiums than Senna, Prost lost the title by 3 points. Mclaren had won
          a Constructor's Championship with three times more points than the
          second place Ferrari. This record was later broken in 2002 by Ferrari.

          The Drivers' Championship was decided in controversial circumstances
          at the penultimate race of the season in Japan, when Prost and
          teammate Ayrton Senna, who needed to win the race, collided in the
          closing laps. Prost retired while Senna rejoined the track after a
          push start and crossed the line first, only to be disqualified for not
          rejoining the track correctly. This handed Prost the title, his last
          with McLaren before joining Ferrari for 1990. Mclaren won the
          Constructors' Championship for a second year in a row.

          teammate Alain Prost, who had made the switch to Ferrari. Prost led
          the championship after three consecutive mid-season wins. Senna fought
          back strongly and went into the penultimate round at the Suzuka
          circuit in Japan with a nine-point lead over Prost. There, Senna took
          pole position only for Prost to beat him off the line. Senna then
          drove into the Frenchman at the first corner, putting both out and
          thus settling the championship in Senna's favour. This was the second
          year in succession that the two drivers had collided at Suzuka.
