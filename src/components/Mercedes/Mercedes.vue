          lead multiple times during the season. Both drivers entered the
          season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix tied on points, which ended with a
          controversial finish, as it was deemed that race control did not
          handle a late safety car period fully according to the regulations.
          Verstappen overtook Hamilton in a late restart, after which Mercedes
          initially protested the results, and later decided not to appeal after
          their protest was denied.
