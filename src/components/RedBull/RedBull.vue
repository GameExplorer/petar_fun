            2010 season was one of the more memorable seasons in F1. New points
            system was introduced and Mercedes re-entered Formula 1. This was
            also Bridgestone's final season in the formula 1 as the company
            decided to leave the sport after 14 years. Pirelli was then chosen
            as the new tyre supplier for the sport. The season also was the
            return of the seven time world champion Michael Schumacher. New
            teams were also introduced to the sport, Hispania, Lotus and Virgin
            Racing.

            secure the title. The season saw Vettel, Alonso, Webber and Hamilton
            battling until the very end for the Driver's title. Vettel's victory
            came after a dramatic season finale at Abu Dhabi. He became the
            youngest formula 1 champion at the age of 23 years and 134 days.<br />

            Vettel dominated the 2013 season. He became the third driver to win
            the four titles in a row. It was one of the most dominated
            championship victories in a history of the sport and it wasn't until
            Max Verstappen in 2021 broke that record. Vettel won the title with
            397 points, 155 points ahead of Fernando Alonso which was a new
            record that was broken by Max Verstappen in RedBull in 2023. Red

            After Checo beat Max in Baku, Max said to his father he will never
            lose to him again. He went on to win 19 out of 22 Grand Prixs,
            failing to win in Singapore where he struggled the most and in
            Saudia Arabia and Azerbaijan where Perez was better. Max won the

            won the constructor's title in Mexico with 800 points, 400 points
            ahead of Ferrari. Max had more points than any 2nd place Ferrari. He
            could have won Constructor's title all by himself. RedBull won 21
            out of 22 Grand Prix beating Mclaren record from 1988.
